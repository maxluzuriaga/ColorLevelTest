ColorLevelTest
==============

Generating procedural colour schemes for an iOS app, based on a linear progression from 0 to 81. Specifically, this would be used with a Sudoku application, to visual represent to the user their progress in a particular puzzle, by changing the whole interface colour scheme from red to green, as they fill in more squares.
